Hi, I'm William

I am a back-end software engineer & architect, "maker", coming from a full-stack background, excited about technical innovation, challenges and solving problems.

I find motivation in **learning new things** and I mainly speak Golang, PHP & Javascript. I work on various exciting projects involving backend architectures, microservices, machine learning and natural language processing.

Oh, and I currently live in London <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg">
